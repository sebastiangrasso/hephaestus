A strong, statically typed language, Hephaestus gives programmers the ability to elegantly craft programs to make computers do the work for them. It's pythonic speech-like syntax makes learning the language easy and it's large access to math operations makes it a great alternative for AI/data science applications. Learn Hephaestus and make you're machine come to life!
